# AldineAmerica
This repository contains the raw code (with some files deleted for security reasons) used to make the website https://www.aldineamerica.com/

A Full-stack Website for a local auto salvage yard created by Maximiliano Alvarado. 

The 'AmericaAPI' folder contains all components for the backend of the website. 
The backend was created with ASP.NET Core API. 
I used Visual Studio for this part, which the solution can be accessed through the 'AmericaAPI.sln' file.

The database was created using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
Every SQL command call from the backend to the database was called through Stored Procedures, with passwords being hashed for extra security. 

The 'FrontEnd' folder contains all components for the frontend of the website. 
The frontend was created with Angular. 
I used Visual Studio Code for this part.

The website contains the store's inventory, which through an admin login, can be added to, edited, and deleted. 

I built, published, and deployed the website using a paid hosting service that uses Plesk as it's hosting control panel. 

This website took about 2 months for me to make as it was my first full-stack website I developed and published on my own. 
I didn't bother making a github repository at first to show my progess which I regret, so this only has one commit which is the final product.
